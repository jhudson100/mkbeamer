Test 1
=========

Slide 1
========

* This is the first item of the first slide
* This is the second item of the first slide
* This is the third item of the first slide

Slide 2
========

* This is the first item of the second slide
    * This is nested item 1
    * This is nested item 2
* This is the second item of the second slide
    * This is nested item 3

Slide Three
===============

* This is the first item of the second slide
    * This is nested level 1
        * This is nested level 2
        * This is nested level 3
            * This is nested level 4
* This is the second item of the second slide

Code
======

* We like writing code

.. code:: python
    :class: size50

    if foo:
        bar()
    else:
        baz()



Code
======

* What if we have larger code?

.. code:: python

    if foo and bar and baz and bam and boom and blarg and blurfle and boomtown and barglebargle:
        bar()
    else:
        baz()

* So there

Images
=======

* We have an svg file here

.. images:: alt=a red sphere,width=30, redsphere.svg


Images
=======

* We have three svg files here

.. images:: width=25, alt=red sphere,redsphere.svg, alt=green sphere,greensphere.svg, alt=blue sphere, bluesphere.svg

Images?
===========

* Perhaps a PNG file is nice

.. images:: width=40,alt=a torus,torus.jpg,width=0,height=20,alt=a cone,cone.png


Scripts
=========

* We must breathe O\ :sub:`2` or H\ :sub:`2`\ O
* x\ :sup:`2` + x + 1 = 0
* It is *important* that we **not** mess up __today__!!!
* Some :raw:`\textbf{raw}` inline content

.. raw::

    We have \textit{here} some raw block content

Math
=====

* We know that :math:`x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1`
* But it is also true that

.. math::

    \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = 1

Characters
=============

* Should we worry about special characters?
    * Is x > y? Or x < y?
    * 100%!
    * a_b_c
    * a\|b
    * #1
    * 1 & 2
    * if(x) {} else { foo }
    * cd ~bob

Lots of Content
===================

* This slide has lots of content
    * Not much that is important, however
    * But we have several items
* Then we have more content
    * Yes, we do
    * Lots and lots of content
        * Tons of it
    * We like content
* Content is the think to be content with
    * Contented content
    * That's the point of contenting yourself with content
    * Content of content
* Table of contents
    * Contents of the table
    * We like contents
* Those are content with contents
    * Pages of content
    * Contented pages
* The end
